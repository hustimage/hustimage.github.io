《图像分析与理解》课程项目-3D Rigid Object Tracking
------
## hustimage.github.io

 this project uses camshift algorithm from OpenCV and 2D Kalman filter is applied on the predictions to smoothen out the errors and make the prediction more robust. 
 
## Requirements and 

 code in this package requires the OpenCV library (known working version is 3.1).
 
## Build and Run

 you need to creat a new vs project,then add the .h(hpp) files and .cpp files to the project in the object tracking folder of the master-branch.
 
 the hot keys  will be shown when the program is running.
