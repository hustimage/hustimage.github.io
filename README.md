《图像分析与理解》课程项目-3D Rigid Object Tracking
------
## hustimage.github.io

 This project uses camshift algorithm from OpenCV and 2D Kalman filter is applied on the predictions to smoothen out the errors and make the prediction more robust. 
 
## Requirements  

 Code in this package requires the OpenCV library (known working version is 3.1).
 
## Build and Run

 You need to creat a new VS project, then add all .h(hpp) files and .cpp files to your project in the object tracking folder of the master-branch.
 
 The hot keys will be shown when the program is running.
 
 Run command as example : project path//object_tracking.exe  d://object.mp4
